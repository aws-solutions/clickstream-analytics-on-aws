# Retention report
You can use the Retention report to get insights into how frequently and for how long users engage with your website or mobile app after their first visit. The report helps you understand how well your app is doing in terms of attracting users back after their first visit.

Note: This article describes the default report. You can customize the report by applying filters or comparisons or by changing the dimensions, metrics, or charts in QuickSight. [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/working-with-visuals.html)


## View the report
1. Access the dashboard for your application. Refer to [Access dashboard](index.md)
2. In the dashboard, click on the sheet with name of **`Retention`**.

## Where the data comes from
Retention report are created based on the following QuickSight dataset:

- `lifecycle_weekly_view-<app id>-<project id>`, which connects to the `clickstream_lifecycle_weekly_view` view in analytics engines (i.e., Redshift or Athena). 
- `lifecycle_daily_view-<app id>-<project id>`, which connects to the `clickstream_lifecycle_daily_view` view in analytics engines (i.e., Redshift or Athena). 
- `retention_view-<app id>-<project id>` that connects to the `clickstream_retention_view` view in analytics engines

Below is the SQL command that generates the view.
??? example "SQL Commands"
    === "Redshift"

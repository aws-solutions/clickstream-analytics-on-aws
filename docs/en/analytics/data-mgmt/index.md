# Data management 
Data Management helps you manage your clickstream data. This module provides the following features:

1. Metadata management. The solution automatically scans the data in your clickstream to generate metadata, making it convenient for you to view and manage all events, event properties, and user properties. You can also modify the display names, descriptions, and data dictionaries of events and properties, making it easy for you to use them in the Exploration Analysis module.

2. Traffic source configuration. You can update the traffic source categorization rules here. [Learn more](../data-mgmt/traffic-source.md)

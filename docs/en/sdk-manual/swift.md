# Clickstream Swift SDK

## Introduction

Clickstream Swift SDK can help you easily collect in-app click stream data from iOS devices to your AWS environments through the data pipeline provisioned by this solution.

The SDK is based on the Amplify for Swift SDK Core Library and developed according to the Amplify Swift SDK plug-in specification. In addition, the SDK provides features that automatically collect common user events and attributes (for example, screen view, and first open) to accelerate data collection for users.

### Platform Support

Clickstream Swift SDK supports iOS 13+.

[**API Documentation**](https://awslabs.github.io/clickstream-swift/)

## Integrate SDK

Clickstream requires Xcode 13.4 or higher to build.

### 1.Add Package

We use **Swift Package Manager** to distribute Clickstream Swift SDK, open your project in Xcode and select **File > Add Packages**.

![](../images/sdk-manual/swift_add_package.png)

1. Enter the Clickstream Library for Swift GitHub repository URL (`https://github.com/awslabs/clickstream-swift`) in the search bar.
2. Check the rules for the version of the SDK that you want Swift Package Manager to install, it is recommended to choose **Up to Next Major Version**, then click **Add Package**.
3. Keep the Clickstream product checked as default.
4. Choose **Add Package** again to finish the package installation.

### 2.Parameter configuration

Download your `amplifyconfiguration.json` file from your Clickstream solution web console, and paste it to your project root folder:

![](../images/sdk-manual/swift_add_amplify_config_json_file.png)

the json file will be as follows:

```json
{
  "analytics": {
    "plugins": {
      "awsClickstreamPlugin ": {
        "appId": "appId",
        "endpoint": "https://example.com/collect",
        "isCompressEvents": true,
        "autoFlushEventsInterval": 10000,
        "isTrackAppExceptionEvents": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Your `appId` and `endpoint` are already set up in it, here's an explanation of each property:

- **appId (Required)**: the app id of your project in control plane.
- **endpoint (Required)**: the endpoint url you will upload the event to AWS server.
- **isCompressEvents**: whether to compress event content when uploading events, default is `true`
- **autoFlushEventsInterval**: event sending interval, the default is `10s`
- **isTrackAppExceptionEvents**: whether auto track exception event in app, default is `false`

### 3.Initialize the SDK

Once you have configured the parameters, you need to initialize it in AppDelegate's `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` lifecycle method to use the SDK.

```swift
import Clickstream
...
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    do {
        try ClickstreamAnalytics.initSDK()
    } catch {
        assertionFailure("Fail to initialize ClickstreamAnalytics: \(error)")
    }
    return true
}
```

### 4.Config the SDK

```swift
import Clickstream

// config the sdk after initialize.
do {
    var configuration = try ClickstreamAnalytics.getClickstreamConfiguration()
    configuration.appId = "appId"
    configuration.endpoint = "https://example.com/collect"
    configuration.authCookie = "your authentication cookie"
    configuration.sessionTimeoutDuration = 1800000
    configuration.isLogEvents = true
    configuration.isCompressEvents = true    
    configuration.isLogEvents = true
} catch {
    print("Failed to config ClickstreamAnalytics: \(error)")
}
```

> Note: this configuration will override the default configuration in `amplifyconfiguration.json` file

### 5.Record event

Add the following code where you need to report an event.

```swift
import Clickstream

let attributes: ClickstreamAttribute = [
    "channel": "apple",
    "uccessful": true,
    "ProcessDuration": 12.33,
    "UserAge": 20,
]
ClickstreamAnalytics.recordEvent(eventName: "testEvent", attributes: attributes)

// for record an event directly
ClickstreamAnalytics.recordEvent(eventName: "button_click")
```

For **Objective-c** project refer to [ClickstreamObjc Api Reference](https://awslabs.github.io/clickstream-swift/Classes/ClickstreamObjc.html)

## Data format definition

### Data type

Clickstream Swift SDK supports the following data types:

| Data type | Range                                                 | Sample        |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Int       | -2147483648～2147483647                                | 12            |
| Int64     | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808～ 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 | 26854775808   |
| Double    | -2.22E-308~1.79E+308                                  | 3.14          |
| Boolean   | true, false                                           | true          |
| String    | max support 1024 characters                           | "clickstream" |

### Naming rules

1. The event name and attribute name cannot start with a number, and only contains uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, if the event name is invalid will throw `precondition failure`, if the attribute or user attribute name is invalid the attribute will be discarded and record error.

2. Do not use `_` as prefix to naming event name and attribute name, `_` prefix is the reserved from Clickstream Analytics.

3. The event name and attribute name are in case-sensitive, So the event `Add_to_cart` and `add_to_cart` will be Recognized as two different event.

### Event & Attribute Limitation

In order to improve the efficiency of querying and analysis, we need to limit events as follows:

| Name                            | Suggestion           | Hard limit           | Handle strategy for exceed    |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Length of event name            | under 25 characters  | 50 characters        | throw error                   |
| Length of event attribute name  | under 25 characters  | 50 characters        | discard, log and record error |
| Length of event attribute value | under 100 characters | 1024 characters      | discard, log and record error |
| Event attribute per event       | under 50 attributes  | 500 event attributes | discard, log and record error |
| User attribute number           | under 25 attributes  | 100 user attributes  | discard, log and record error |
| Length of User attribute name   | under 25 characters  | 50 characters        | discard, log and record error |
| Length of User attribute value  | under 50 characters  | 256 characters       | discard, log and record error |

**Explanation of limits**

- The character limits are the same for single-width character languages (e.g., English) and double-width character languages (e.g., Chinese).
- The limit of event attribute per event include common attributes and preset attributes.
- If you add the same name of attribute or user attribute more than twice, the last value applies.

## Preset events and attributes

### Preset events

Automatically collected events:

| Event name       | When to trigger                                                                        | Event Attributes                                                                                                  |

| _os_update       | device operating system is updated to a new version                                    | _previous_os_version                                                                                              |
| _user_engagement | when the app is in the foreground at least one second                                  | _engagement_time_msec<br>                                                                                         |
| _profile_set     | when the `addUserAttributes()` or `setUserId()` api called.                            |                                                                                                                   |

#### Session definition

In Clickstream Swift SDK, we do not limit the total time of a session, as long as the time between the next entry of the app and the last exit time is within the allowable timeout period, we consider the current session to be continuous.

- **_session_start**: When the app starts for the first time, or the app was launched to the foreground and the time between the last exit exceeded `session_time_out` period.

- **_session_duration**: We calculate the `_session_duration` by minus the current event create timestamp and the session's `_session_start_timestamp`, this attribute will be added in every event during the session.

- **session_time_out**: By default is 30 minutes, which can be customized through the configuration api.

- **_session_number**: The total number of session distinct by session id, and `_session_number` will appear in every event's attribute object.

#### User engagement definition

In Clickstream Swift SDK, we define the `user_engagement` as the app is in the foreground at least one second.

- **when to send**: We send the event when the app navigate to background or navigate to another app.

- **engagement_time_msec**: We count the time from when the app comes in the foreground to when the app goes to the background.

# Clickstream Web SDK

## Introduction

Clickstream Web SDK can help you easily collect click stream data from browser to your AWS environments through the data pipeline provisioned by this solution.

The SDK is based on the amplify-js SDK core library and developed according to the amplify-js SDK plug-in specification. In addition, the SDK provides features that automatically collect common user events and attributes (for example, screen view, and first open) to accelerate data collection for users.

## Integrate the SDK

### Include SDK

```bash
npm install @aws/clickstream-web
```

### Initialize the SDK

You need to configure the SDK with default information before using it. Copy your configuration code from your clickstream solution web console, the configuration code should look like as follows. You can also manually add this code snippet and replace the values of appId and endpoint after you registered app to a data pipeline in the Clickstream Analytics solution console.

```typescript
import { ClickstreamAnalytics } from '@aws/clickstream-web';

ClickstreamAnalytics.init({
   appId: "your appId",
   endpoint: "https://example.com/collect",
});
```

Your `appId` and `endpoint` are already set up in it.

### Start using

#### Record event

Add the following code where you need to record event.

```typescript
import { ClickstreamAnalytics } from '@aws/clickstream-web';

ClickstreamAnalytics.record({ name: 'albumVisit' });
ClickstreamAnalytics.record({
  name: 'buttonClick',
  attributes: { _channel: 'SMS', Successful: true }
});
```

## Data format definition

### Data types

Clickstream Web SDK supports the following data types:

| Data type | range                       | sample                |
|-----------| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| number    | 5e-324~1.79e+308            | 12, 26854775808, 3.14 |
| boolean   | true„ÄÅfalse                  | true                  |
| string    | max support 1024 characters | "clickstream"         |

### Naming rules

1. The event name and attribute name cannot start with a number, and only contains: uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, if the event name is invalid, the SDK will record `_clickstream_error` event, if the attribute or user attribute name is invalid, the attribute will be discarded and also record `_clickstream_error` event.

2. Do not use `_` as prefix to naming event name and attribute name, `_` is the preset from Clickstream Analytics.

3. The event name and attribute name are in case-sensitive, so the event `Add_to_cart` and `add_to_cart` will be recognized as two different event.

### Event and attribute limitation

In order to improve the efficiency of querying and analysis, we apply limits to event data as follows:

| Name                            | Suggestion           | Hard limit           | strategy                          | error code   |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| Event name invalid              | --                   | --                   | record `_clickstream_error` event | 1001         |
| Length of event name            | under 25 characters  | 50 characters        | discard, record error event       | 1002         |
| Length of event attribute name  | under 25 characters  | 50 characters        | discard, log and record error     | 2001         |
| Attribute name invalid          | --                   | --                   | record `_clickstream_error` event | 2002         |
| Length of event attribute value | under 100 characters | 1024 characters      | discard, log and record error     | 2003         |
| Event attribute per event       | under 50 attributes  | 500 evnet attributes | discard, log and record error     | 2004         |
| User attribute number           | under 25 attributes  | 100 user attributes  | discard, log and record error     | 3001         |
| Length of User attribute name   | under 25 characters  | 50 characters        | discard, log and record error     | 3002         |
| User attribute name invalid     | --                   | --                   | record `_clickstream_error` event | 3003         |
| Length of User attribute value  | under 50 characters  | 256 characters       | discard, log and record error     | 3004         |

!!! info "Important"

    - The character limits are the same for single-width character languages (e.g., English) and double-width character languages (e.g., Chinese).
    - The limit of event attribute per event include preset attributes.
    - If the attribute or user attribute with the same name is added more than twice, the latest value will apply.

## Preset events and attributes

### Preset events

Automatically collected events:

| Event name         | Triggered                                                                                                                                                                         | Event Attributes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### Session definition

In Clickstream Web SDK, we do not limit the total time of a session, as long as the time between the next entry of the browser and the last exit time is within the allowable timeout period, we consider the current session to be continuous.

**_session_start**: When the website open for the first time, or the browser was open to the foreground and the time between the last exit exceeded `session_time_out` period.

**_session_duration**: We calculate the `_session_duration` by minus the current event create timestamp and the session's `_session_start_timestamp`, this attribute will be added in every event during the session.

**session_time_out**: By default is 30 minutes, which can be customized through the configuration api.

**_session_number**: The total number of session distinct by session id, and `_session_number` will be appeared in every event's attribute object.

#### User engagement definition

In Clickstream Web SDK, we define the `user_engagement` as the webpage is in focus at least one second.

**when to send**: We send the event when the browser is close, hide or navigate to another  web page in different domain.

**engagement_time_msec**: We count the time from when the web page is visible to when the web page is hidden.
